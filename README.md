## About Me
- ðŸ’¼ I'm a Java Full Stack Developer with a passion for building end-to-end web applications that are scalable, maintainable, and user-centric. With hands-on experience in developing both frontend interfaces and backend systems, I specialize in delivering full-featured solutions that solve real-world problems.

On the backend, I work extensively with Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Hibernate, RESTful APIs, and Microservices Architecture. Iâ€™m also proficient in SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB for database design and optimization.

For the frontend, I build dynamic and responsive UIs using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Bootstrap, and Thymeleaf. I also utilize tools like Git, Maven, Jenkins, Docker, and Postman to streamline development, testing, and deployment processes.

I follow Agile/Scrum methodologies, collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, and strive to write clean, testable, and efficient code. Iâ€™m continuously exploring new technologies and best practices to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of software development.
